# Does Environmental Disclosure Matter?  
*Evidence from Textual Analysis of 10-K Filings*

## Overview

This project studies whether environmental language in 10-K filings helps explain U.S. stock returns beyond standard risk factors. Using ClimateBERT models, we construct:  
- **ENV Score**: share of environmental content  
- **ENV Sentiment**: tone of environmental language  

We apply these variables to Fama-French three- and five-factor models across 70 S&P 500 firms from 2018–2023.

The FF3 FF5 folder contains the analysis where I first perform Fama-French three- and five-factor regressions using only standard factors, and then extend the models by adding firm-specific environmental variables (ENV Score and ENV Sentiment) to assess their contribution to explaining stock returns. It also includes the trend analysis of ENV Score and ENV Sentiment over time.
